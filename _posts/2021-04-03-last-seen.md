## Use Case
Suppose your manager tells you - "Joe, remember that table where we keep maxmind data? Can you figure out when we saw an the ip last time around and send it on a stream? Gini will write a consumer to look at some patterns, don't bombard him".

## Thinking process
Wait, what is maxmind? Quick google search says they provide location data for IP addresses. Ok, so something like 205.101.100.247 -> Istanbul.

Alright, lemme look at the code... Hmm, we keep a cache of this mapping and only query the table, then maxmind in case of a miss in that order.
```java
LoadingCache<String, String> cache =
    CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
                .expireAfterWrite(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
                .build(new CacheLoader<String, String>() {
                    @Override
                    public String load(String key) {
                        // Query Table and then MaxMind
                        return UUID.randomUUID() + "_place";
                    }
                });
```

Ok, so we have a cache that expires keys (i.e ips) 5 minutes after it has been written to. So, when did we see it last? Obvious answer seems to be whenever it expires, right?

## What can we do about it?
Wonder if this cache to tell me when it expires keys. Well, it has built in support for that with removal listeners. 

Removal listener is invoked whenever cache removes a key from its store, you can add your own code on what to do with it like the below.

Code Snippet
```java
LoadingCache<String, String> cache =
    CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
                .expireAfterWrite(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .removalListener((RemovalListener<String, String>) notification -> {
                    System.out.printf("Removal listener called since %s with %s %s \n", notification.getKey(), notification.getValue(), notification.getCause());
                    // Wrap key, value and time in an object and pass it along the stream for Gini.
                })
                .build(new CacheLoader<String, String>() {
                    @Override
                    public String load(String key) {
                        // Query Table and then MaxMind
                        return UUID.randomUUID() + "_place";
                    }
                });

// Testing
System.out.println(cache.get("205.101.100.247")); // -> 26be9f3a_place (totally random place)

Thread.sleep(10_000);                             // sleep for 10 seconds

System.out.println(cache.get("205.101.100.247")); // -> Removal listener called since 205.101.100.247 with 26be9f3a_place EXPIRED
                                                  // -> 14e3c237_place (totally random place again)
```

Hope this was clear enough.

## Gotchas
1. Sometimes removal listener might not be called (implementation detail), this is because guava doesn't have cleanup threads. It relies on get, write to happen on the same segment of the expired key to happen. In our case the last get call is actually invoking the segment read and hence the removal listener. Reference - https://stackoverflow.com/a/12157670
2. The last print statement should return the same place in a production environment considering we queried Maxmind with the same ip but this is testing, I can do what I want. haha.
