## Use Case
Suppose your manager tells you - “Joe, remember that table where we keep MaxMind data? Can you figure out when we saw an IP the last time around and send it on a stream? Gini will write a consumer to look at some patterns, also... don’t bombard him”.

## Thinking process
Wait, what is MaxMind? MaxMind is a company that provides location data given an IP. Ok, something like 205.101.100.247 -> Istanbul.

Alright, lemme look at the code the manager is talking about... it has been a while and I need a refresher.
```java
LoadingCache<String, String> cache =
    CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
                .expireAfterWrite(5, TimeUnit.MINUTES)
                .build(new CacheLoader<String, String>() {
                    @Override
                    public String load(String key) {
                        // Query Table and then MaxMind
                        return UUID.randomUUID() + "_place";
                    }
                });
```
Ok, so we have a cache (essentially a key-value map with additional features) that stores IP and its location. After 5 minutes, the cache forgets the mapping.

Coming back to "when did we see it last"? The obvious answer seems to be whenever the cache forgets about it, right?

## What can we do about it?
Wonder if this cache has a hook that is invoked when it forgets something? Well, it has built-in support for that - "removal listeners".

```java
LoadingCache<String, String> cache =
    CacheBuilder.newBuilder()
                .expireAfterWrite(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                .removalListener((RemovalListener<String, String>) notification -> {
                    System.out.printf("Removal listener called since %s with %s %s \n", 
                                      notification.getKey(), 
                                      notification.getValue(), 
                                      notification.getCause());
                    // Wrap key, value and time in an object and pass it along the stream for Gini.
                })
                .build(new CacheLoader<String, String>() {
                    @Override
                    public String load(String key) {
                        // Query Table and then MaxMind
                        return UUID.randomUUID().toString().split("-")[0] + "_place";
                    }
                });

// Testing
System.out.println(cache.get("205.101.100.247")); // -> prints 26be9f3a_place (totally random place)
System.out.println(cache.get("205.101.100.247")); // -> prints 26be9f3a_place (same random place)

Thread.sleep(10_000);                             // sleep for 10 seconds

System.out.println(cache.get("205.101.100.247")); // -> Removal listener called since 205.101.100.247 with 26be9f3a_place EXPIRED
                                                  // -> and prints 14e3c237_place (totally random place again)

```
The inline testing comments above should make the behavior of removal listener clear.
Lemme know if it doesn't. I'm @anirudhonezero. Thanks for reading along.

## Gotchas
1. Sometimes removal listener might not be called (implementation detail), this is because guava doesn't have cleanup threads. It relies on get, write to happen on the same segment of the expired key to happen. In our case, the last get call invokes the segment read and hence the removal listener. Reference - https://stackoverflow.com/a/12157670
2. The last print statement should return the same place in a production environment considering we queried Maxmind with the same IP but for simplicity purposes, I changed it :)
